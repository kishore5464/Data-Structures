# Data-Structures
Data Structures + Algorithms using Java

  Here I plan to start Datastructures and Algorithms from scratch. For that I started learning each concepts with N.no.of resources like YouTube, Udemy, PluralSight and Book (Cracking the Coding Interview : 189 Programming Questions and Solutions by Gayle Laakmann McDowell).
    
Agenda which I am learning and commiting in GitHub:
---------------------------------------------------

1. Big O (Time Complexity),
    a. Big O(1)       -> (Constant Time)
    b. Big O(log N)   -> (Logarithmic Time)
    c. Big O(N)       -> (Linear Time)
    d. Big O(N log N) -> (Linearithmic Time)
    e. Big O(N^2)     -> (Quadratic Time)
    f. Big O(N^3)     -> (Cubic Time)
    g. Big O(2^N)     -> (Exponential Time)
    h. Big O(N!)      -> (Factorial Time)
